Thanks for purchasing Modular Research Center.

To make showcase level look correctly, add Post Processing Stack to your project from Window -> Package Manager.
Set correct Post Process profile in Post-process Volume (for Gamma or Linear color spaces).
You can change color space in Edit->Project Settings->Player menu.
Make sure that you have PostProcessing layer (Layers -> Edit Layers - User Layer 8). 
In Camera settings use Deferred Rendering Path with MSAA turn off, HDR turn off.
Use Temporal AA to get the best results (Can be set in Post Processing Profile).
